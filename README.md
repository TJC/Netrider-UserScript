Netrider userscript
-------------------

This userscript for Tampermonkey adjusts netrider's website a little.
It strips out some of the more objectionable content for viewing in
the workplace, such as the background image of a girl on a motorcycle,
all the male/female symbols, and all users' avatar images.

Installation
------------

To install this, you'll first need to install Tampermonkey from the Chrome web
store. After that, go into Tampermonkey and choose to add a new script, and
then enter this URL:
