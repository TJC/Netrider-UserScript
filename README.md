Netrider userscript
-------------------

This userscript for Tampermonkey adjusts netrider's website a little.
It strips out some of the more objectionable content for viewing in
the workplace, such as the background image of a girl on a motorcycle,
all the male/female symbols, and all users' avatar images.

Installation
------------

To install this, you'll first need to install Tampermonkey from the Chrome web
store. Once it's installed, just come back here and click this URL, then
select the Accept box that pops up to install it.
